# Instrument-Cluster-controll-board
Controll your instrument cluster with single arduino! No can-bus module needed!

The instrument cluster controll board allows to take controll of 4 gauges and should work with instrument clusters using X25 stepper motors or similar.
In my case I used instrument cluster from Jaguar X-type 2.0d.

## Why do I need this?
Have you become the owner of the inctrument cluster of the car you don't own, don't have diagrams or don't know the CAN-BUS headers?
This solution plugs directly into stepper motors on the pcb, and allows you to take controll of the neeedles, skiping CAN-BUS and rest of the pcb electronics.
It requires no additional motor controllers, just Arduino.

## What do I need?
 * Arduino nano (soldered)
 * 32x 1N4001 rectifying diodes (8 for each motor)
 * At least 23x17 perfboard
 * Some steel wire
 * 0,25mm cable wire
 * female connectors
 * Instrument cluster (duh)
